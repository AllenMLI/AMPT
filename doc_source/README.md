# Building Docs

In order to build the documentation you must have [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and
the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme installed. The preferred way to do this is
to MkDocs in a Python virtual environment in `./venv`. The core requirements are in the `requirements-core.txt` file.

## The Easy Way
Run `make all` which will attempt to build a virtual environment and construct the documentation.
